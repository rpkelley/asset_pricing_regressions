# asset_pricing_regressions
Using regressions in R to examine asset pricing models.

Using data from the French Data Library and Kaggle, I look at different asset pricing models, including the Capital Asset Pricing Model (commonly known as CAPM) and also the Fama-French three factor model (FF). Both of these models are based on linear relationships, and so will be examined using a series of linear regressions.
